# Etch-A-Sketch Project

This repository contains the source code for my implementation of the Etch-A-Sketch project from The Odin Project's curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a web-based application that simulates the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Overview

The Etch-A-Sketch project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course, which helps students practice and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic CSS styling.

## Features

- **(Flexbox)-Grid Display**: A customizable grid where users can "draw" by hovering their cursor over the cells.
- ~~**Color Selection**: Users can choose different colors to draw with.~~ (to be implemented)
- **Size Adjustment**: Users can adjust the size of the grid to have more or fewer cells.
- ~~**Reset Button**: Allows users to clear the grid and start new drawings.~~ (to be implemented)
