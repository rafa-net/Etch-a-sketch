/* TODO: Add borders for container visualization 
Know that the grid can't be created statically i.e. using a loop that takes in a fixed number 
The squares change sizes: how? `calc()`? Variables? 
Functions? Unknown methods?
But the container stays fixed.
Read all the briefing before attempting project. */

/* My mistake was that the borders were altering the size of the squares and messing everything up. */
